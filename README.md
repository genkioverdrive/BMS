# BMS
BMS development roadmap using STM32L476RG

## Initial Targets:
- [x] Create main project and forks for every feature
- [ ] Figure out communication from master to slave
- [ ] Create macros for each message register
- [ ] SPI message decoding
- [ ] Daisy chaining 2 modules for proof of concept

## End goals:
- [ ] PEC (packet error code) using crc calculation based on the datasheet
- [ ] Passive cell balancing algorithm
- [ ] SOC calculation
